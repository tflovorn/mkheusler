Some changes may be required to use SG15 pseudopotentials with SOC turned on in ONCVPSP.
In some cases ONCVPSP may not converge without changes, while in others ghosts states may appear.

Ni 1.0: no adjustment
Hf 1.1: no adjustment
Sn 1.1: SG15 base with SOC turned on has ghost in D- at 0.5 Ha. D rc -= 0.1, qc += 0.1 is used to eliminate this ghost.
